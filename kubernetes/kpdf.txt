Kubernetes - It is container orchestratio platform



Docker Cons: 
-- Container can die and revive any time (Single host)
-- No Auto healing (Container wont start by itself)
-- Auto Scaling (No feature to scale up)
-- No loadbalancer inbuilt (No way to distribute the traffic)
-- No enterprise level support


What is Enterprise ready:
1. Load balancer

Kubernetes Pro:

-- Kubernetes is installed as clusters
-- Kubernetes has replica sets to handle the traffic
-- Auto Healing
